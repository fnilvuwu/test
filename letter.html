        Happy Turn Legal 18th, Wawa ❤️
        <br>
        I always forgot how fast time went fly ever since the first time we met and am still ur favorite senior. Now that we've been together for so long, you probably surprised at how messy am as an individual. And am grateful so happy for all of the times that we've been through
        <br>
        Cause today will be your day, the day when you deserve the best that the world could offer and the day to throw all of your worries away. Kusayang sekaliki' juga, am proud of you. Don't let that red color wash out your burning spirit! Let it be another love to keep us forward, together as a whole. Thank you for staying by my side despite my idiocy and the reckless favor that i keep begging for (i still dont give up for it tho haha, sorry, you know me well XD)
        <br>
        You got this sayang ❤️
        <br>
        You will be an amazing person
        <br>
        You will make ur parents go proud
        <br>
        You will went through this, just like all of the things that we've been through
        <br>
        Just know that am only one call away, so just hmu everytime you need ❤️
        <br>
        Cause you're the snorkel all of the time that i can't breath and you've infused my life with laughter (Tennyson - You). Yes you, my love, wawa
        <br>
